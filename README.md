# Sales Summary Application\n\nThis is a single-page responsive web application designed to fetch sales data from a `data.csv` file, calculate the total sales, and display the summary on the page. The application is built using modern web standards, featuring a clean, responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Dynamic Title:** The page title updates to reflect "Sales Summary [Period/Seed]".\n*   **Data Fetching:** Automatically fetches `data.csv` from the same directory.\n*   **Sales Aggregation:** Parses the CSV to sum the 'sales' column.\n*   **Responsive UI:** Adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on any device.\n*   **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly messages for common issues like missing files or malformed data.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.\n*   **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and responsive design.\n*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For data fetching, parsing, and DOM manipulation.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\nTo run this application:\n\n1.  **Save the files:** Ensure `index.html` and `data.csv` are placed in the same directory.\n2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.\n\nThe application will automatically fetch `data.csv`, calculate the total sales, and display it.\n\n### `data.csv` Format\n\nThe `data.csv` file must be a comma-separated values file with a header row. It must contain a column named `sales`. Example:\n\n```csv\nproduct,sales,region\nWidget A,123.45,North\nGadget B,67.89,South\n```\n\n## Customization\n\n*   **Seed Value:** The "seed" value (e.g., 'Q4') displayed in the title and on the page is defined within the JavaScript code in `index.html`. You can modify `const seed = 'YOUR_VALUE';` to change this.\n*   **Styling:** All styling is managed via Tailwind CSS classes directly within `index.html`.
